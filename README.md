# Advent of Code 2022

My Python solutions to Eric Wastl's "Advent of Code" 2022. This was my first Advent of Code.

Links below go to my code for each day and the time it took me to solve from the time the puzzle released.

Puzzles are always released at midnight EST, which is 5:00 a.m. UK time where I am, and I did not wake up early for this, so my earliest solve time, for Day 10 Part 1, was around 9:30 a.m., it doesn't matter as the competitive programmers fill the top 100 slots in the leaderboard in a couple of minutes every day. My highest ranked solve was #4526 for Day 22 Part 2. The only puzzle I did not solve within the 24 hours of release was Day 19 Part 2.
