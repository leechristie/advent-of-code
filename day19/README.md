# Advent of Code 2022

## Day 24: Blizzard Basin

Solution code by [leechristie](https://github.com/leechristie) for Advent of Code 2022.

Today was a complete mess.

I had to go to Java, run on 10 cores to get part 1.

Part 2 I didn't even get done until th 24th Dec.

My code finds that the answer is at least 11 × 47 × 25 = 12925.

After messing around a lot, trying patterns, random search, I eventually guessed that 11 and 25 are correct and the answer was actually 11 × 49 × 25 = 13475.

I really should try to figure out if there's a way to do this problem better and get it to find the right answer.
